Explanation for why <agg function > (<aggattr>) is <higher/lower> than expected for <G = g>:

In general <V> predict<s> <aggfunction>(<attr>) for most <F>. This is also true for <F = f>.

Hoever, for <V=v> the value of <aggfunction>(<attr>) is <higher/lower> than predicted.

This may be explained through the <lower/higher> than expected outcome for <V=countbalance_v>. 

This explanation was ranked <unlikely, plausible, highly pausible> 
because the counterbalance is <similar, somewhat similar, not similar> to the user question 
and it deviates  <slighlty, "" , extremly> from the predicted outcome. 

Explanation for why sum(publcount) is lower 
than expected for name=Ax,venue=KDD,year=2007:
In general year and venue predict sum(pubcount) for most authors.
This is also true for name=Ax.
Hoever, for year=2007,venue=KDD
the value of sum(publcount) is lower than predicted.
This may be explained through the higher than expected outcome 
for year=2007,venue=ICDE.
