  This explanation was ranked <unlikely, plausible, highly pausible> 
because the counterbalance is <similar, somewhat similar, not similar> to the user question 
and it deviates  <slighlty, "" , extremly> from the predicted outcome. 

If only_relevent:
	Explanation for why sum(publcount) is lower 
	than expected for name=Ax,venue=ICDE,year=2009:
	In general year predicts sum(pubcount) for most authors.
	This is also true for name=Ax.
	However, for year=2009
	the value of sum(publcount) is lower than predicted.
	This may be explained through the higher than expected outcome 
	for year=2010. 
else:
    Even though like many other authors, year predicts sum(pubcount), Ax's publication
    in venue=icde, year=2009 is low which maybe explained by his higher than usual
    number of publications in year = 2008, venue = icde
